## General Information
- By using  Exploratory data analysis(EDA) to understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
    a. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    b. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
